All of the images in this directory were created by Hampus Olsson and can be
downloaded on his website http://www.hampusolsson.com/oneplus

Images whose names end with "_r(-?)90.(png|jpg)$" have been altered. If
"r90" appears before the suffix that means it was rotated 90 degrees with the
command `convert original.png -rotate 90 original_r90.png`. If "r-90" appears
before the suffix the image was rotated -90 degrees. Images that have been
altered can be found in the originals/ directory.
